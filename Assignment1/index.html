			I want to be a Web developer and want to explore my innovative side.
			I think web developers are cool innovative artists who have the thirst for learning hence create some cool stuff which is practical in usage as well. I want to be a part of it. As one says "the power of software is undeniable" and I believe that the world is my oasis. </p> <br> 
			<p>I am a fun person,who loves to read, paint, and cook in the free time. I love to travel and explore new places. I wish the world becomes a better and more kinder place to live in. I want to bring more positivity around me. My mantra for life is "Be Kind and Courageous".</p>
